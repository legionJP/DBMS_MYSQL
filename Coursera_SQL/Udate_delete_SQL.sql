-- Using the update statements to update data 

UPDATE TABLE_name SET columun_name1 = 'udated_info', COLUMN_name2='updated_info'
WHERE ID =1;

Deleting the data 

DELETE FROM student-tabl1 where name='akash';

-- Deleting the multiple records from the table 
 we use the where caluse , where the name of the columun value is similar for the multiple records 
 then it is easier to delete multiple records :

 DELETE from student_tb where department = 'common for many records /rows'
