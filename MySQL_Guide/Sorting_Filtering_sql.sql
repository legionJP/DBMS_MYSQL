--Order by Clause:

-- used for ordering and sorting the data

-- sorting the data in the differnet forms 
-- How ASC and DESC keywords behave when  uswed to short the data

--Syntax:
SELECT COLUMN1, COLUMN2, COLUMN3 from TABLE_name order ORDER by COLUMN_name ASC | Desc;


--Order by column for multiple syntax:
SELECT COLUMN1, COLUMN2, COLUMN3 from TABLE_name  ORDER by COLUMN1 ASC, column2 DES;

SELECT * from TABLE_name ORDER BY column1 , column2 ASC|DESC; -- not executing in the mysql
-- if the ASC or DSC is not mentioned the default order will be the ASC 
--Numeric data is ascending or descending in the order of numerical ordrer and 
-- String data sorts the data in the aplhabetical order

/*
Consider sorting the data by the City column which has a text data type of VARCHAR.
 If you want to sort the customer data by city, use the following SELECT statement:

 SELECT * 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY City;   
  -- and the ordering will happen in the asc.

--select column1, column2,.... from table_name where condition; 

*/
condition is use for the criteria of the filter

operand follow the operator
operand: it can be either a text value or numeric value 
operator:  1. comparison operaotr=, < , >, <= ,etc.
          2). Between  : It can filter records within numeric or time and date range

          4) IN : it specify the multiple possibel values for COLUMN
          , and operators 
          6) !< checks if the value of the left operand is not less than the value of the right operand. If yes, then condition becomes true.
          7) !>

SELECT column1, column2 from table_1 where name='john';
